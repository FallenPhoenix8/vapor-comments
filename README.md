**Running dev script**

In order to run the dev.sh script, you need to have `watchexec` installed on your system.
If you are using brew package manager, it can be installed with following command:

```zsh
brew install watchexec
```

Then you can run the dev script with
```zsh
sh ./dev.sh
```
